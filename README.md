# ESP32 Motor Driver Module Project

## Project Overview
The ESP32 Motor Driver Module project demonstrates how to control a motor using an ESP32 microcontroller and a motor driver module. This project can be used in various applications such as robotics, automation systems, and remote-controlled vehicles.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Motor Driver Module (e.g., L298N)
- DC Motor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Power Supply for the Motor

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Motor Driver to ESP32:**
   - **IN1 (MotorPin1):** Connect to GPIO 14 on the ESP32.
   - **IN2 (MotorPin2):** Connect to GPIO 12 on the ESP32.
   - **EN (EnablePin):** Connect to GPIO 27 on the ESP32.
   - **Motor Terminals:** Connect the motor terminals to the output terminals of the motor driver module.
   - **Power Supply:** Connect the power supply to the motor driver module to power the motor.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication for debugging purposes.
   - Set the motor control pins (motorPin1, motorPin2, enablePin) as outputs.
   - Initialize the motor to be stopped by setting motorPin1 and motorPin2 to LOW and enablePin to 0.

2. **Operation:**
   - Implement motor control operations in the following sequence:
     - **Rotate Motor Clockwise:** Set motorPin1 to HIGH, motorPin2 to LOW, and enablePin to 255 to rotate the motor clockwise at full speed. Rotate for 2 seconds.
     - **Stop Motor:** Set motorPin1 and motorPin2 to LOW and enablePin to 0 to stop the motor. Wait for 1 second.
     - **Rotate Motor Counterclockwise:** Set motorPin1 to LOW, motorPin2 to HIGH, and enablePin to 255 to rotate the motor counterclockwise at full speed. Rotate for 2 seconds.
     - **Stop Motor:** Repeat the stopping process as before.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Power Supply:** Ensure the motor driver module and the motor are powered adequately to handle the load.
   - **Speed Control:** Adjust the PWM value of the enablePin to control the speed of the motor.
   - **Heat Management:** The motor driver module may heat up during operation, so consider adding heat sinks or fans if necessary.

## Applications
- **Robotics:** Control motors in robotic arms, wheels, or other moving parts.
- **Automation Systems:** Implement motor control in conveyor belts, doors, or other automated systems.
- **Remote-Controlled Vehicles:** Use motor control to drive wheels and steering mechanisms in RC cars or drones.

## Notes
- **PWM Control:** Use PWM signals on the enablePin to set the speed of the motor.
- **Direction Control:** The combination of HIGH and LOW signals on motorPin1 and motorPin2 determines the rotation direction of the motor.
